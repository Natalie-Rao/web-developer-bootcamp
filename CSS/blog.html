		Businesses governments and individuals create massive collections of data as a by-product of their activity. Increasingly data is analyzed systematically to improve decision-making. In many cases automating analytical processes is necessary because of the volume of data and the speed with which data are generated
		
	</p>

	<p>
		We will study the fundamental principles and techniques of mining data and we will examine real-world examples and cases to place data-mining techniques in context to improve your data-analytic thinking and to illustrate that proper application is as much an art as it is a science. In addition we will work hands on with data mining software.
		
	</p>

	<p>
		After taking this course you should: Approach business problems data analytically. Think carefully & systematically about whether & how data can improve business performance to make better-informed decisions. Be able to interact competently on business analytics topics. Know the fundamental principles of data science that are the basis for analytics processes algorithms & systems.

		The Urban Science Intensive (USI I) is part of a two-semester capstone sequence that is the experiential learning focus of the program. USI I takes place over 14 weeks in the Spring semester and prepares students for delivering Capstone Projects in the summer. The core of the course is team-based work on a real-world urban problem, combining problem identification and evaluation, data collection and analysis, data visualization and communication, and finally, solution formulation and testing.  
		
	</p>

	<p>
		The expectation is that during USI I, the students will be assigned to the capstone teams and will conclude preliminary phases of the capstone work, including planning and scoping the project, literature review, selection of the research methodology as well as data acquisition, cleaning, pre-processing. The USI II will focus on finalizing project analytics and drafting final deliverables.
		
	</p>

	<p>
		This course is the introduction to data and analytics strategies, tactics, tools that cities deploy in order to bring resolution to a wide variety of complex and important challenges and concerns. This will include a detailed accounting of the use of data acquisition and management, integration, and analytics through the thorough investigation of case studies. In this course, the student will learn the major concepts, tools, and techniques for what informatics can do for cities.
